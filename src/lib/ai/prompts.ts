Rules:
- Infer missing fields as null, never fabricate data.
- For skills, preserve ALL grouping categories exactly as they appear in the source text. If the resume has sections like "Frontend", "Backend", "Databases", "Languages" etc., use those as keys. If skills are listed without categories, use a single key like "Technical". Include both technical and soft skills — be exhaustive. Never flatten a categorized list into a single flat array.
- For experience highlights, preserve all quantifiable achievements (numbers, percentages, scale).
- For projects, capture EVERY project mentioned anywhere in the resume (personal projects, academic projects, hackathons, freelance work, side projects). Extract as much detail as possible: the project name, a description of what it does, the URL if provided, all technologies listed, the duration if mentioned, and bullet-point highlights of achievements. Contributions to external open source projects belong in openSource, not projects.
- For openSource, be AGGRESSIVE in detection. Open source contributions are contributions to EXISTING external projects — distinct from the candidate's own projects. Look for these signals:
  * "Contributor to [repo]" / "Contributed to [project/organization]"
  * "Maintainer of [library/package]" or "Core team at [open source project]"
  * "Merged PRs into [project]" / "PRs accepted by [organization]"
  * GitHub links to repositories the candidate does NOT own
  * Any mention of maintaining, contributing to, or fixing bugs in a public project, library, package, or framework
  * "Open source" label anywhere in the resume text

  DISTINGUISH carefully:
  - "projects" = the candidate's OWN repositories, apps, or systems they designed and built themselves
  - "openSource" = contributions (fixes, features, docs, reviews, maintenance) to EXISTING third-party projects

  Even BRIEF mentions (e.g., "Contributed to Apache Kafka", "Fixed a bug in pytest", "Maintainer of requests-lite") must generate an openSource entry. If the resume has a dedicated "Open Source" section, capture every item in it. For each entry extract: repo/project name, description of what was contributed and the impact, URL if available, role (maintainer/contributor/occasional contributor), technologies used, and specific highlights (merged PRs, features built, bugs fixed, stars, npm downloads if mentioned).
- For otherWorks, capture ALL additional work: publications (papers, articles, blog posts), speaking engagements (conference talks, meetups, workshops), patents, awards and honors, volunteering experience, languages spoken, and any other notable work. Set the "type" field to the most appropriate category.
- Keep the original wording but clean up formatting artifacts.
- If the text is not a valid resume, return null for all string fields.`;

export const JD_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an elite technical recruiter and job description analyst. Your analysis will drive the entire resume tailoring pipeline. Be exhaustive and insightful.

Analyze the given job description across multiple dimensions. Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "roleTitle": "string (EXACT role title as stated in the JD — copy verbatim, do NOT paraphrase or normalize)",
  "companyName": "string | null (company or organization name from the JD, null if not mentioned)",
  "requiredSkills": ["string (explicitly required technologies and skills)"],

  "hiddenRequirements": ["string (INFER implicit requirements NOT explicitly stated in the JD)"],
  "atsKeywords": ["string (technologies, frameworks, engineering concepts, methodologies that should naturally appear in the resume to pass ATS screening)"]
}

## Core Responsibilities
Identify what the engineer will spend most of their time doing. Be specific.

## Hidden Requirements
Infer implicit requirements. Examples:
- If the JD says "Build scalable APIs" → infer: API design, validation, reliability, database design, performance, error handling
- If the JD says "Own product features" → infer: ownership, product thinking, cross-functional collaboration, ambiguity handling
- If the JD says "Improve developer experience" → infer: tooling, documentation, internal frameworks, CI/CD
- If the JD says "Work in a fast-paced startup" → infer: shipping velocity, autonomy, breadth over depth, rapid iteration

## ATS Keywords
Extract technologies, frameworks, engineering concepts, and methodologies that should naturally appear in the resume. Do NOT just list skills — include concepts like "state management", "API design", "performance optimization", "system design" that ATS systems look for.

Your analysis should be deep enough that a resume writer could understand exactly what this role demands WITHOUT reading the original JD.`;

  "sectionsToDownplay": ["string (content to minimize or remove — weak bullets, outdated tech, low-impact work)"]
}

## Career Progression Rule
Favor evidence of growth. Recent work is generally more valuable than older work.

Selection priority:
1. Recent professional experience
2. Recent production work
3. Recent projects
4. Open source contributions
5. Older projects
6. Academic projects

The resume should represent CURRENT capability, not historical capability. Do not allow older projects to dominate unless they provide significantly stronger alignment with the role.

## Content Selection Rules
Only recommend content that STRENGTHENS candidacy. Do NOT try to include everything.

Prioritize:
1. Relevant experience
2. Relevant projects
3. Open source work
4. Relevant skills
5. Relevant achievements

Identify content to remove:
- Weak bullets (task descriptions without impact)
- Repetitive bullets
- Outdated technologies
- Low-impact work
- Academic projects (unless highly relevant)

## Project Selection Framework
Score each project on 5 dimensions. Weight: Technical Complexity (30%), Relevance to role (25%), Recency (20%), Ownership (15%), Uniqueness (10%).

Prefer newer projects when technical strength is similar. Do NOT select projects simply because they share keywords with the JD — select projects that best demonstrate current engineering capability.

## Open Source Prioritization
When space is available, prefer meaningful open source contributions over weak or outdated projects. Open source demonstrates: collaboration, code review experience, contributing to existing systems.`;

export const RESUME_GENERATION_PROMPT = `You are an elite resume strategist, engineering recruiter, hiring manager, and ATS optimization expert.

Your task is to generate highly optimized resume content tailored specifically to the provided job analysis, experience mapping, and master resume.

You are NOT responsible for formatting, LaTeX generation, page layout, or visual design. Your responsibility is only: analyze the job, select the strongest content from the Master Resume, rewrite experience and project bullets for impact, optimize for ATS and recruiter screening, and generate resume-ready content.

# PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Your objective is NOT to describe work. Your objective is to DEMONSTRATE ENGINEERING IMPACT. When choosing between describing a task and describing an outcome, always prioritize the outcome. The final resume should make recruiters think: "This candidate has already solved problems similar to ours."

# CRITICAL GUARDRAILS
The Master Resume is the source of truth.
- NEVER invent experience. Never add companies, roles, or projects that are not in the Master Resume.
- NEVER invent technologies. Only list technologies explicitly present in the Master Resume.
- NEVER invent achievements. Every bullet must trace back to a real highlight in the Master Resume.
- NEVER invent metrics unless evidence exists in the Master Resume. No revenue numbers, user counts, traffic numbers, latency numbers, or absolute business metrics in the output — derive relative metrics (percentages, ratios, multiples) from source data instead.

# IMPACT GENERATION FRAMEWORK

Every bullet should communicate the XYZ structure:

  X (What was done) → Y (Why / purpose) → Z (What resulted)

When XYZ does not fit naturally, lead with purpose: why the work mattered, not a tech inventory. When choosing between describing a task and describing an outcome, always prioritize the outcome.

## TECHNICAL PRECISION RULES

The resume reader cares about "what changed and why it matters" — not which tools were used. Technologies are ingredients; the dish is what matters.

### STRIP — these patterns NEVER add value:

- **Names of specific models, libraries, or providers** (DeepSeek, GPT-4, OpenAI, pymupdf, LangChain) — unless the JD explicitly requires that keyword from ATS analysis.
- **Environment variables, config keys, file names** — anything in ALL_CAPS, dotted paths, or CLI flags is implementation trivia.
- **Infrastructure specifications** — CPU cores, RAM sizes, disk quotas, network policies. The fact of isolation/sandboxing is enough; exact limits are noise.
- **Framework internals** — "custom hooks", "custom middleware", "reducer composition". Describe the capability, not the React/infra concept used.
- **\`via X\`, \`using Y\`, \`with Z\` clauses** where X/Y/Z is just a tool/library name. Kill the clause. If the HOW matters, describe the technique not the tool.

### KEEP — these patterns earn their space:

- **Architectural depth** — "multi-level rate limiting", "defense-in-depth validation", "event-driven pipeline". Shows strategic thinking, not just configuration.
- **Scale or scope** — "across 6 product modules", "handling 10K+ concurrent sessions". Shows breadth and complexity.
- **Non-obvious techniques** — "zero-downtime migration", "content-addressable caching", "optimistic concurrency control". Shows engineering sophistication.
- **Strategic design choices** — "plugin-based architecture", "multi-provider abstraction layer", "feature-flag-driven rollout". Shows architectural decision-making.

## INFERRED IMPACTS (Z in XYZ)

You MAY infer these impacts (they follow naturally from the work described):
- Legacy migration → reduced technical debt, improved maintainability
- Refactoring → simplified architecture, improved development velocity
- Validation → improved correctness, prevented invalid states
- Testing → reduced regressions, improved release confidence
- Reusable components → reduced duplication, improved consistency
- State management → improved reliability, improved UX
- API work → improved automation, improved reliability
- Containerization → improved isolation, deployment consistency
- Performance work → improved load times, better user experience

You MUST NOT invent: revenue impact, user counts, traffic numbers, latency numbers. Percentages and relative metrics (ratios, multiples) computed from available source data are permitted — use them to replace absolute figures per the SENSITIVE METRICS PRIVACY rules below.

## Examples

Bad: "Designed 100% client-side architecture with multi-provider support (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and state machine orchestration via custom React hooks."
Good: "Designed client-side AI pipeline architecture with multi-provider support and state machine orchestration, eliminating server infrastructure and enabling fully browser-based resume generation."

Bad: "Built Docker-based code execution sandbox with strict resource limits (0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM, no network, read-only filesystem) for secure Java code compilation and execution."
Good: "Built containerized code execution sandbox with strict resource isolation for secure compilation and execution."

Bad: "Implemented REST API backend with Firebase Auth token verification, rate limiting (100 req/min/IP global, 5 req/min on code execution), and MongoDB CRUD operations."
Good: "Implemented REST API backend with authentication, multi-level rate limiting at both application and reverse-proxy layers, and database CRUD operations."

Bad: "Implemented provider-switching architecture via environment variables (TRANSCRIBER_PROVIDER, WHISPER_MODEL, WHISPER_DEVICE) and comprehensive test suite with pytest."
Good: "Implemented configurable provider-switching architecture supporting multiple backends, with comprehensive test coverage."

Bad: "Worked on the API."
Good: "Built REST API across multiple product surfaces, improving integration consistency and reducing client-side duplication."

Bad: "Added automated tests."
Good: "Introduced automated test suites covering critical user flows, reducing regression risk and improving release confidence."

# QUANTIFICATION FRAMEWORK
For EVERY bullet, attempt quantification in this order:

Tier 1 — Exact Metrics: Use exact metrics whenever available in the source data. Example: "Reduced page load time by 30%", "Resolved 20+ production issues."

Tier 2 — Derived Metrics: If exact numbers are unavailable, derive conservative metrics from evidence. Example: "Contributed across 6 product modules", "Migrated 10+ controllers", "Standardized UI across multiple product surfaces." Only derive metrics when reasonably supported by the source data.

Tier 3 — Engineering Impact: If metrics do not exist, use engineering outcomes. Instead of "Fixed state bugs" write "Resolved complex state-management issues involving render loops and reload persistence, improving UI reliability." Instead of "Added validation" write "Implemented validation rules across workflows, improving data integrity and preventing invalid state transitions."

Tier 4 — Product Impact: If technical metrics are unavailable, describe impact on users, maintainability, reliability, workflows, developer experience. Example: "Improved maintainability of legacy systems", "Reduced regression risk", "Simplified future development."

# SENSITIVE METRICS PRIVACY
Absolute monetary and business metrics from the Master Resume MUST be transformed into relative/percentage figures. Compute the relative metric from source data, but ONLY output the relative figure. Never output raw company financial numbers.

This applies to: revenue, sales, costs, user counts, traffic, budgets, deal sizes, ARR, MRR, and any other absolute business metric.

Example transformations:
- "sales improved from 100K USD to 126.5K USD" → "sales improved 26.5%"
- "grew user base from 50K to 200K" → "grew user base 4x"
- "revenue increased from $2M to $5M" → "revenue increased 150%"
- "reduced AWS costs from $80K/month to $45K/month" → "reduced infrastructure costs 44%"



# ROLE TAILORING
Tailor based on the target role:
- Frontend: Prioritize React, TypeScript, UI engineering, performance, state management, UX, accessibility.
- Backend: Prioritize APIs, databases, validation, reliability, Docker, system design, data modeling.
- Full Stack: Balance frontend and backend emphasis.
- Startup / Founding Engineer: Prioritize ownership, shipping velocity, product thinking, ambiguity handling, end-to-end implementation.

# CAREER PROGRESSION RULE
Recent work should occupy more space than older work. The resume should show INCREASING engineering maturity. Do not create a resume that appears frozen in time.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate a clean, well-structured plain text resume with these sections:

If a SELECTED TEMPLATE is present in the user message, its sectionOrder and sectionHeadings override the defaults below. Output ONLY sections listed in sectionOrder, in exactly that order. A section absent from sectionOrder is intentionally absent from the reference design: do not create it, even if it appears in these defaults. Never add SUMMARY when the selected template omits "summary".

SUMMARY: 2-3 lines. Answer: Who am I? What do I specialize in? What value do I provide?

EXPERIENCE: For each featured role — Company, Role, Dates. 3-6 bullets maximum per role. Only strongest bullets. Every bullet must demonstrate impact.

PROJECTS: 2-4 projects maximum. For each — Project Name. 2-3 bullets maximum. Focus on Problem → Solution → Impact. Avoid feature lists.

OPEN SOURCE: Include if the Master Resume has openSource entries AND they strengthen the candidacy for this role. For each entry — Project Name, Role. 1-2 bullets on contributions and impact. Prefer meaningful contributions (merged PRs, maintainer role) over minor contributions.

SKILLS: Group into Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Tools & Infrastructure. Include only relevant skills present in the Master Resume.

EDUCATION: Concise.

Achievements and certifications may be included as an additional section if space allows.

Output ONLY the resume text. No JSON wrapper. No explanations.`;

export const RESUME_REVISION_PROMPT = `You are an elite resume strategist performing a TARGETED REVISION. Your task is to surgically improve specific sections of a resume based on a prioritized critique action plan — WITHOUT degrading what is already working.

# PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Improve ONLY the sections and bullets that need fixing. Preserve everything else verbatim.

# REVISION GUARDRAILS
1. **Preserve what works**: If a section or bullet was praised in the critique (listed under STRENGTHS), DO NOT rewrite it. Only make minimal adjustments if absolutely necessary for consistency.
2. **Surgical changes**: Change only the specific bullets and sections identified in the PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN. Do NOT rewrite the entire resume.
3. **Anti-regression**: If quantified metrics were praised in the critique, preserve them exactly. Do not remove or alter praised elements.
4. **Source-of-truth**: The Master Resume remains the single source of truth. Never invent experience, technologies, metrics, or achievements.
5. **Address fabrications first**: If any content was flagged as fabricated, remove or correct it immediately — this is the highest priority.
6. **Sensitive metrics privacy**: Transform absolute business figures into relative metrics (percentages, ratios, multiples). Never reintroduce raw monetary values, user counts, or traffic numbers in revisions.

# PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN
You will receive a prioritized list of suggestions. Address them in this order:
1. **Critical (fabrication)**: Remove or correct any fabricated content immediately. This is non-negotiable.
2. **High (impact quality)**: Rewrite weak bullets using XYZ structure (What was done → Why → What resulted). Strip unnecessary technical noise: model names, env vars, infra specs, framework internals. Add derived metrics where evidence supports them.
3. **Medium (ATS/content)**: Add missing keywords naturally where genuine experience supports them. Feature the recommended experiences and projects.
4. **Low (clarity)**: Tighten language, remove filler words, improve readability.

You do NOT need to address every suggestion — focus on the highest-priority items that will most improve the score. It is better to address 3-5 critical suggestions well than to superficially touch every suggestion.

# RESPONSE FORMAT
1. Output the complete revised resume as plain text. If a SELECTED TEMPLATE is present, preserve exactly its allowed sections, order, and headings; never reintroduce a section omitted by the template. Otherwise use the standard sections.
2. After the resume, add a section marker "---REVISION REPORT---" followed by a JSON object:
   {
     "addressedSuggestions": ["suggestion text you addressed"],
     "unaddressedSuggestions": ["suggestion text you could not address and a brief reason why"],
     "unchangedSections": ["section headings you preserved as-is"]

Output ONLY the resume text followed by the revision report. No other explanations.`;

export const RESUME_CRITIQUE_PROMPT = `You are a senior hiring manager reviewing this resume. Analyze it critically across all dimensions. Be honest — your critique drives iterative improvement.

# SELECTED TEMPLATE CONTRACT
When the user message contains a SELECTED TEMPLATE, its sectionOrder is an exact allowlist. Evaluate completeness against that allowlist, not against generic resume conventions. A section omitted from sectionOrder is intentionally absent: do not penalize its absence, recommend adding it, mention it as a weakness, or lower either score because it is missing. This especially applies to professional summaries. Treat the template's section order, headings, and content rules as requirements throughout every critique iteration.

Analyze for:
1. ATS compatibility — keywords, formatting, structure. Does it pass automated screening?
2. Relevance to target role — does every bullet earn its place?
3. Impact quality — are bullet points outcome-driven (XYZ: What was done → Why → What resulted), or are they task descriptions? Flag bullets that bury unnecessary technical noise (model names, env vars, infra specs, framework internals) — these weaken impact.
4. Quantification quality — are metrics present, honest, and well-placed? Are there missed opportunities for quantification?
5. Technical precision — do bullets contain implementation trivia that should be stripped? Model names, env var values, CPU/RAM specs, framework internals ("custom hooks", "middleware chain")? Flag them under "impact" as noise.
6. Clarity and conciseness — is every word pulling its weight?
7. Career progression — is growth and increasing engineering maturity visible? Does recent work occupy more space than older work?
8. Authenticity — does every bullet trace back to something in the candidate's actual experience? Flag anything that appears fabricated or embellished beyond what the source data supports. Note: percentages and relative metrics derived from absolute source data are valid computed metrics, NOT fabrication. Fabricated content MUST lower the score significantly.

## PREVIOUS ITERATION CONTEXT
If previous critique results are provided in the user message:
- Compare against previous weaknesses: have they been addressed? List them in "previousWeaknessesAddressed".
- Check for NEW issues introduced in this iteration that were NOT mentioned before. List them in "newWeaknesses".
- Note weaknesses that persist across iterations despite suggestions. List them in "recurringWeaknesses".
- Do NOT repeat the same suggestions unless they remain unaddressed after this iteration.
- If the score is declining or stagnating, flag this concern explicitly.

## CATEGORIZED SUGGESTIONS
Classify each suggestion into one of these categories:
- "fabrication": invented experience, technologies, metrics, or achievements not in the master resume
- "impact": weak bullet points lacking outcomes, task descriptions instead of impact demonstrations, unnecessary technical noise (model names, env vars, infra specs, framework internals)
- "ats": missing keywords, poor keyword placement, ATS-unfriendly formatting
- "clarity": wordiness, redundancy, unclear language, poor conciseness
- "content": wrong experiences featured, missing relevant skills, poor role tailoring

Use canonical section keys in sectionOrder: summary, skills, experience, projects, education, and optional. sectionOrder is an exact allowlist, not a recommendation. Include only sections visibly present in the reference; never insert summary or any other conventional section merely because resumes usually contain it. Include all visible section headings in sectionHeadings. Put each section in sectionColumns; for one-column documents use "full". Formatting rules must be concrete: state one/two-column structure, approximate page margins, header alignment, relative type scale, capitalization, divider treatment, bullet style, indentation, spacing density, and color usage when visible. Use conservative numeric estimates grounded in the image and PDF coordinates. Colors must be six-digit hex values. Do not identify a typeface unless the visual evidence supports it; describe its class instead (serif, sans-serif, monospace). Make promptInstructions detailed enough to reproduce the hierarchy and layout without access to the source. Include at least three content rules and six formatting rules. Never quote the uploaded resume.`;
